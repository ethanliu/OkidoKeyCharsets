### 關於 CC-CEDICT

CC-CEDICT is a continuation of the CEDICT project.
The objective of the CEDICT project was to create an online,
downloadable (as opposed to searchable-only) public-domain Chinese-English dictionary.
CEDICT was started by Paul Andrew Denisowski in October 1997.
For the most part, the project is modeled on Jim Breen's highly
successful EDICT (Japanese-English dictionary) project and is intended to be a
collaborative effort, with users providing entries and corrections to the main file.
